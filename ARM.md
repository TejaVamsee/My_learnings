# ARM ARCHEITECTURE

## Defination
- ARM architecture refers to a family of processor architectures created and licensed by Arm Ltd.
- It follows the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing).It is designed for high performance with minimal power usage.
- Applications like IOT devices, Smart phones and Embedded system.

## Keywords before going to understand the ARM Archtecture  
- Core
- Processor
- RISC AND CISC
- Arm consists like Registors,pipelining,Instruction set

## Core
- A core in ARM architecture is an individual processing element within a CPU that is capable of executing instructions and managing tasks independently.
- Each core contains its own components such as registers, an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), a control unit, an instruction decoder.

## Processor
- A processor is also called as CPU (Central Processing Unit), is the primary part of a computer or device responsible for carrying out calculations, running instructions, and controlling the movement of data.
- The processor is the entire CPU unit, which may contain either a single core or multiple cores. Besides the cores, it also includes other components such as cache memory and control units.
- Multi-core CPUs: ARM processors often come with 2, 4, 6, or 8 cores (or more in high-end devices) to increase performance.

## ARM Architecture Components
- Registors
- Instruction Set
- Pipelining
- Memory Management Unit (MMU)
- Interupts and Exceptions
