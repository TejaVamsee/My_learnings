# Memory Errors
- When a program improperly uses the memory causes the memory errors.
- Memory errors are caused by reading or writing to invalid memory locations, forgetting to free memory, or accessing memory after it has been freed.
- These results in undefined behavior, which means the program can crash, produce incorrect results, or appear to work but fail unpredictably later.

# Tools to detect the memory Errors
-  Valgrid - linux,Unix
-  AddressSanitizer - Linux,Windows
-  LeakSanitizer - Linux

# Debbuger
- Gdb (Gnu debugger) - to debug the Segmentation error

## Memory Leak
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
    int* ptr = malloc(100); // never freed
    return 0;
}

```
